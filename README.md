# Whale Talk: Array Project

## Description

A simple array project that helped me practice loops.

## Challenges

On line 26 the project asked that two methods be used simultaneously. I didn't know they could be used back to back like that. I thought they could only be nested within each other. After giving it 24hrs, I tried using Bard for help. Ultimately, I used Codecademy's walkthrough video to see the solution.

## Takeaways

Testing your code as you go helps ensure each part works. For example, after building each for loop I tested it with a console log. This told me whether or not the loop was counting the correct thing. My first for loop incorrectly displayed the letters of the input array because I passed "input". Later I realized the console.log needed to be passed "i" to display the index instead. This taught me specificity.
